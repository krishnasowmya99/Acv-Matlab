#For FACE RECOGNITION :
This code performs face tracking using a webcam. It first initializes a face detector and a point tracker. It then captures frames from the webcam, converts them to grayscale, and detects faces in the frame using the face detector. If a face is detected, the script initializes the point tracker using the detected face region and tracks the movement of the face in subsequent frames. If the number of tracked points falls below a certain threshold, the script re-detects the face and initializes the point tracker again. The code also draws a polygon around the detected face and displays the video stream with the tracked face using a video player. The loop continues until the video player is closed or a maximum number of frames have been processed. Finally, the script releases all resources used in the process, including the camera, video player, point tracker, and face detector.
